# GraphOfVirginiaCitiesByRoad README

## Introduction

GraphOfVirginiaCitiesByRoad is a Java-based application that creates a graph of major Virginia cities and computes the shortest path between any two cities by road. It utilizes the JGraphT library to manage and process graph data efficiently.

## Features

- Initializes a simple weighted, unidirectional graph of select cities in Virginia.
- Finds the shortest path between any two cities based on road distances.
- Uses JGraphT for graph operations and pathfinding algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17 or later.
- JGraphT core library (version 1.5.2).
- JHeaps library (version 0.14).

Download [JGraphT Library](https://www.jgrapht.org/download.html), manually (not using Maven), unarchive it, find the two jars in the lib folder, and add them to your Build Path.


### Step 3: Set Up the Project

1. Open your Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Import the files
3. Ensure that the following files are included in your project:
   - `edu/vwcc/citygraph`
   - `AnyTextReader.java`
   - `GraphHelper.java`
   - `Main.java`
   - `DrivingDistances_CitiesVA.txt`
4. Add the JGraphT and JHeaps libraries to your project's build path.

## Usage

1. Run `Main.java` to start the application.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input two Virginia cities.
3. The program will display the shortest path by road between the selected cities.
